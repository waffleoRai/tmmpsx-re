This is my "notes" and "decomped" code repo for my work noodling with a certain PS1 game.

As I have made no attempt to match code, and indeed haven't even tried messing with setting up a PS1 build chain, it's not a proper decomp. Just tryin to figure out how certain parts of the code work since that's my idea of fun.

Don't try to build it, I guess. It'll probably blow up your computer. Er... well your compiler will tell you to go to hell, anyway.
